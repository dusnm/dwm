# My build of dwm (Dynamic Window Manager)

In my humble opinion the defaults dwm comes with are completely unusable, hence this is yet another patched version among many.

### Included patches

-   **alwayscenter** (centers floating windows)
-   **restartsig** (restarts dwm with a keybinding)
-   **attachbottom** (attaches new windows to the bottom of the stack, instead of to the top)
-   **fullgaps** (adds useless gaps for aesthetics)
-   **monoclesymbol** (makes the monocle symbol always appear in statusbar)
-   **scratchpad** (adds a hidden terminal "scratchpad" that can be pulled up with a keybinding)
-   **statusallmons** (displays the statusbar on all monitors)
-   **warp** (warps the mouse cursor when switching tags)

### Additional dependencies

-   **alacritty** (instead of st)
-   **my shell scripts** (for functionality such ash the volume indicator)
-   **Jetbrains Mono** (default font)
-   **font-awesome** (icon font)
